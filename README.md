Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the automated process of identifying and extracting the subjective information that underlies a text. It emerges as a challenging field with lots of obstacles as it involves natural language processing while having a wide variety of applications that could benefit from its results, such as news analytics, marketing, question answering, etc.
Getting important insights from opinions expressed on the Internet, especially from social media and blogs, is vital for many companies and institutions; whether it is in terms of product feedback, public mood, or investors opinions.

Sentiment analysis is a difficult technology to get right. However, when you do, the benefits are great.
